## Who are we?

**MINT** stands for **M**unich **Int**ernational. We are a mixed ultimate team of Germans, expats and everything in between. We are part of Munich’s [ESV Freimann](https://esvfreimann.org/) sports club and train regularly at the [ESV pitches](https://goo.gl/maps/JhK54zKzgv22) in the northern part of Munich. We are always happy to welcome new players who have at least basic ultimate experience.

Throughout the year, we hit up a variety of grass and beach tournaments around Germany, Spain, Italy, Austria, Poland and other nearby countries. We believe in playing hard as long as we’re always having a damn good time doing it. Come join us!
